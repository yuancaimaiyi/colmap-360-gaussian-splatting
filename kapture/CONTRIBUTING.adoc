== Overview

There are many ways to contribute to the kapture project:

* provide feedback and suggestions of improvements
* submit bug reports in the project bug tracker
* provide a dataset in kapture format that we can add to the downloader tool
* implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue
* add support of kapture format in other software packages (e.g. SfM pipelines...), thus adding support for more datasets
* provide scripts to create data in kapture format (e.g. local/global feature extraction)
* propose a new feature and implement it

We're happy to help you make kapture better, so please mail us at kapture at naverlabs+com for additional information.

The rest of the document concerns software contributions.

== Coding guidelines

.Style Guide
kapture code follows Python's link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/[PEP-8 guidelines] with a few differences:

* Maximum Line Length is 120 characters
* function arguments types should be specified
* return types of functions should be specified

Docstrings are written in the `sphinx` format.

.Conventions

* Variable names should be explicit (e.g. avoid acronyms)
* private member variables should start with an `_` (underscore)

.File headers
All kapture source code files should start with this line:
[source,txt]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3
​# Copyright 2020-present NAVER Corp. Under BSD 3-clause license
----

.Loggers
The library and the clients should use different loggers.

.Documentation

All API functions should be properly documented using docstrings

== Unit testing

kapture's testing is located under tests/. Run the entire test suite with

[source,txt]
----
python -m unittest discover -s tests/
----

or run individual test files, like `python test/test_nn.py`, for individual test suites.

== License

Contributions will be provided under the same license as kapture, that is the 3-Clause BSD license (see LICENSE for details).
